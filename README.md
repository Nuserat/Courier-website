The Courier Website is a computer program that helps send packages. It has different parts:

Login: Where the companyâ€™s workers and the boss can enter the system.
Order Taking: It collects all the information about the sender and the receiver, like where they live, their names, and phone numbers.
Tracking: After sending a package, the sender or receiver can check where it is on the internet using a special code.
Quick Updates: The system tells you where your package is just one minute after you send it.
Admin Control: The boss can change information or add new packages in the system.
User Profile: Shows information about the person sending the package.
Pricing: Tells you how much sending the package will cost, based on how heavy it is.
In short, this system makes it easy for someone to send a package to someone else and keep track of it until it reaches its destination.
